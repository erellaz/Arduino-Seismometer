# Arduino Seismometer
Arduino based seismometer.
- Arduino ZeroMkr board (with SD Card slot for records saving), ZeroMKR board also has the highest (12 bits) Analog to Digital converter resolution of all current boards.
- GPS-MKR shield for precise timing of the events recorded and position of the module 
- External voltage divider to read both positive and negative voltage from the Geophone, as the Arduinos otherwise only reads positive voltage.
